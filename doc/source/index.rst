Welcome to Waarp Analyze's documentation!
=========================================

Waarp Analyze is a tool that gathers information about Waarp instances
and about the server it runs on.

It is useful to generate reports about the state of the system when a
transfer is in error, or to verify the global configuration.

Reports are generated in Restructured Text and can be converted to any
format supported by docutils_ (or pandoc_, or any RST converter).
